RFID Antenna Placement Optimization for Warehouse Coverage
Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing the placement of RFID antennas in a warehouse environment using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The goal is to achieve maximum coverage of the warehouse while avoiding interference between antennas. The warehouse layout is defined as a grid where walls are represented by 1s and empty spaces by 0s. Antennas are placed on empty spaces, and their coverage is propagated across the grid. The optimization process aims to minimize the repulsion between antennas while maximizing coverage. Reflections from walls are also considered in the coverage calculation.

How the Code is Structured
The code is structured into several key sections:

Warehouse Layout (warehouse_map): The warehouse layout is represented as a 2D NumPy array, where 1 denotes a wall and 0 denotes an empty space where antennas can be placed.

Particle Initialization: The particles (representing antenna placements) are initialized randomly at valid (empty) locations in the warehouse grid.

Coverage Calculation: The main function compute_coverage() calculates the signal coverage provided by the antenna placement. It also takes into account repulsion between antennas and adjusts the coverage based on the warehouse layout and critical zones (areas surrounded by walls).

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO): The PSO algorithm is implemented in the main loop where particles move according to the velocity update rules. Each particle represents a candidate solution (antenna placement), and the fitness (coverage) is calculated for each particle. The global best solution is updated based on the highest fitness value.

Visualization: Two types of visualizations are generated:

Coverage Heatmap: A heatmap showing the coverage strength across the warehouse.

Overlap Map: A map showing the number of antennas covering each cell in the warehouse.

Final Output: After the optimization loop, the best antenna placement is visualized through the heatmap and overlap map, and the fitness history is plotted to track the optimization process.

Key Functions and Their Roles
1. compute_coverage(antennas, repulsion_weight=0.5, critical_zone_weight=2.0)
Role: Calculates the coverage score for a given antenna placement. It simulates signal propagation, accounts for critical zones, and computes the repulsion penalty between antennas.

Key Parameters:

antennas: An array of antenna positions (x, y).

repulsion_weight: Weight for the repulsion penalty between antennas.

critical_zone_weight: Weight for the penalty in critical zones surrounded by walls.

Returns: A float representing the coverage score.

2. plot_coverage_heatmap(warehouse_map, antennas)
Role: Plots a heatmap showing the signal coverage across the warehouse, with antennas placed on top.

Key Parameters:

warehouse_map: The warehouse layout (2D grid).

antennas: The final positions of the antennas.

Returns: None (visualizes the heatmap).

3. plot_coverage_overlap(warehouse_map, antennas)
Role: Plots an overlap map showing the number of antennas covering each cell in the warehouse.

Key Parameters:

warehouse_map: The warehouse layout (2D grid).

antennas: The final positions of the antennas.

Returns: None (visualizes the overlap map).

Hyperparameters and Their Effects
The performance and results of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm can be significantly influenced by the choice of hyperparameters. Here are the key hyperparameters used in this project, along with their roles and effects:

1. w (Inertia Weight)
Role: Controls the influence of the previous velocity on the current velocity. It helps balance exploration (global search) and exploitation (local search).

Tuning Effect:

A high w (e.g., 0.7-1.0) promotes exploration, allowing the particles to cover a larger search space. This is useful in the early stages of the algorithm.

A low w (e.g., 0.3-0.5) promotes exploitation, where particles converge faster to local optima. This can help refine solutions after the algorithm has explored the search space.

Suggested Range: 0.5–1.0

2. c1 (Cognitive Weight)
Role: Controls the influence of a particle's best-known position on its velocity. It encourages particles to move towards their own personal best solution.

Tuning Effect:

A high c1 (e.g., 1.5–2.0) will cause particles to place more emphasis on their own past experience, which can improve convergence speed but may lead to local optima if set too high.

A low c1 reduces the attraction to the personal best, causing particles to rely more on the social best (the best-known position among all particles).

Suggested Range: 1.5–2.0

3. c2 (Social Weight)
Role: Controls the influence of the global best position (i.e., the best solution found by the swarm) on a particle's velocity. It encourages particles to move towards the global best solution.

Tuning Effect:

A high c2 promotes faster convergence towards the global best, but may lead to premature convergence (getting stuck in local optima).

A low c2 will slow down convergence and maintain exploration, allowing the particles to explore more solutions before converging.

Suggested Range: 1.5–2.0

4. num_particles (Number of Particles)
Role: Determines the number of candidate solutions (particles) used in the swarm. More particles provide better exploration of the search space but increase computational cost.

Tuning Effect:

A higher number of particles increases the search space coverage but can make the algorithm slower, especially in terms of computation.

A lower number of particles reduces computational load but may result in a less thorough search and poorer solutions.

Suggested Range: 50–100 particles

5. num_ants (Number of Antennas)
Role: Defines the number of antennas to be placed in the warehouse. It directly influences the complexity of the problem.

Tuning Effect:

A higher number of antennas leads to more complexity and a larger search space, which may result in better coverage but also higher computational cost.

A lower number of antennas simplifies the problem but may result in less coverage and a suboptimal solution.

Suggested Range: Depends on the warehouse layout and desired coverage.

6. signalrange (Signal Decay Factor)
Role: Controls how quickly the signal strength decays with distance. This affects the coverage area for each antenna.

Tuning Effect:

A higher signalrange increases the coverage area of each antenna, which may lead to fewer antennas being needed for full coverage.

A lower signalrange results in a more localized coverage area, requiring more antennas to cover the same space.

Suggested Range: 0.3–0.5 (adjust based on the scale of the warehouse and desired signal propagation)

7. repulsion_weight (Repulsion Weight)
Role: Controls how much the algorithm penalizes placing antennas too close to each other. This helps avoid interference between antennas.

Tuning Effect:

A higher repulsion_weight will force the algorithm to space antennas further apart, ensuring less interference but possibly leading to less optimal coverage.

A lower repulsion_weight allows antennas to be placed closer together, potentially improving coverage but at the risk of increased interference.

Suggested Range: 0.2–1.0

Assumptions
The warehouse is represented by a grid, where 1 indicates a wall and 0 indicates an empty space suitable for antenna placement.

Antennas can only be placed in valid positions (empty spaces, marked by 0).

Signal propagation follows an exponential decay model, with a maximum distance of 8 units.

Repulsion between antennas is modeled by penalizing placements that are too close.

Critical zones are areas where antennas face higher coverage penalties due to walls or narrow paths.

Known Issues
Signal Propagation and Reflections:

The current model assumes signal reflections only from vertical and horizontal walls. More complex reflection models (e.g., diagonal reflections) are not implemented.

Particle Swarm Optimization:

PSO may converge to local minima depending on the initial particle positions and PSO parameters. It may require tuning for different warehouse sizes or antenna counts.

Warehouse Layout:

The current warehouse layout is fixed in the script. Future improvements could include allowing dynamic generation or loading of different layouts.

Performance:

The code may not be optimal for very large warehouses or a high number of antennas due to the complexity of the PSO algorithm and coverage calculations.

Future Improvements
Dynamic Warehouse Layout: Allow users to input different warehouse layouts or import them from external files.

Enhanced Reflections: Implement more accurate reflection models that account for diagonal walls and multiple reflective surfaces.

Performance Optimization: Optimize the PSO algorithm or implement parallelization for larger problem sizes.

User Interface: Provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to visualize and interact with the warehouse layout and antenna placement.
